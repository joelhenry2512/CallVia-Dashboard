# How to Redeploy on Vercel

## Option 1: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign in to your account
3. Find your "CallVia-Dashboard" project
4. Click on the project
5. Go to the **"Deployments"** tab
6. Find your latest deployment
7. Click the **three dots (...)** on the right side
8. Click **"Redeploy"**
9. Wait for the deployment to complete

## Option 2: Force Redeploy by Pushing New Commit

If you want me to force a redeploy right now, I can:

1. Make a small change to trigger a rebuild
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will auto-deploy

Would you like me to do this? Just say "yes" and I'll trigger a redeploy.

## Option 3: Install Vercel CLI (For Future)

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
cd /Users/joelhenry/CallVia-Dashboard
vercel --prod
```

**Which option would you like?**
- Option 1: You do it manually (fastest)
- Option 2: I'll trigger it for you
- Option 3: Install CLI for future use
