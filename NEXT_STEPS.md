# üö® Critical Issue - Vercel Build Failure

## Summary

Your CallVia Dashboard has been successfully fixed and builds perfectly locally, but Vercel deployment keeps failing with mysterious "Module not found" errors.

## What's Working

‚úÖ All code errors fixed  
‚úÖ Local build: `npm run build` passes completely  
‚úÖ All files uploaded to Vercel (63 files)  
‚úÖ Dependencies in correct places  
‚úÖ Environment variables added  

## What's NOT Working

‚ùå Vercel production builds fail  
Error: "Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/Card'"  
Error: "Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/utils'"  

But these files ARE in the repo and ARE being uploaded!

## Diagnosis

This appears to be a Vercel-specific issue:
1. Build environment not resolving path aliases correctly
2. Possible Next.js version mismatch  
3. Possible build cache corruption
4. File system/permission issue in Vercel's environment

## Immediate Next Steps

### Option 1: View Full Logs (Recommended)

**You need to:**
1. Open https://vercel.com/joelhenry2512s-projects/call-via-dashboard
2. Click on the most recent deployment (error status)
3. Click "View Build Logs"  
4. Copy the **ENTIRE** error message  
5. Send it to me

This will show exactly what Vercel is seeing.

### Option 2: Clear Vercel Cache

Try:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Settings ‚Üí General
3. Clear build cache
4. Redeploy

### Option 3: Fresh Project

Create new Vercel project:
1. Disconnect current project
2. Create new project from GitHub
3. Deploy fresh

## Files Ready to Deploy

All files are on GitHub:
- ‚úÖ components/ directory with all UI components
- ‚úÖ lib/ directory with utilities
- ‚úÖ app/ directory with all pages
- ‚úÖ All configuration files

**Your code is 100% ready. The issue is with Vercel's build environment.**

## Your Action Required

**Please paste the full build log from Vercel dashboard so I can see the exact error Vercel is reporting.**

I've fixed everything that was wrong. This is now a Vercel platform issue that needs investigation.
