# Deployment Status - CallVia Dashboard

## Current Situation

✅ **Local Build:** PASSING  
❌ **Vercel Build:** FAILING  
✅ **Code:** All fixed  
✅ **Environment Variables:** Added  

## Issue

Vercel is reporting "Module not found" errors for components and lib files, even though:
- Files exist in GitHub
- Local build works perfectly  
- All 63 files are being uploaded to Vercel

## What We Fixed

1. ✅ Removed deprecated experimental.serverActions
2. ✅ Fixed supabase.raw() calls  
3. ✅ Fixed date arithmetic issues
4. ✅ Fixed Stripe API version
5. ✅ Fixed Supabase client imports
6. ✅ Removed duplicate files
7. ✅ Added missing environment variables
8. ✅ Moved tailwindcss, autoprefixer, postcss to dependencies

## Files Being Uploaded

Vercel shows: "Downloading 63 deployment files..."  
This matches our git ls-files count.

## Next Steps

The issue is likely:
1. Git integration vs CLI deployment mismatch
2. Build cache issue on Vercel's end
3. Path resolution issue in Vercel's build environment

## Solution

Since the code is on GitHub, let Vercel auto-deploy from Git instead of using CLI.

### Instructions:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Open "call-via-dashboard" project  
3. Go to Settings → Git
4. Connect to GitHub repo (if not already)
5. Deploy from main branch
6. Vercel will build from GitHub directly

This should work because:
- All files are in GitHub
- Local build passes
- Auto-deploy uses Git, not CLI upload
