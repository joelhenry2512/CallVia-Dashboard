# ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Status - Final Update

## What We Know

âœ… **Code is 100% ready**  
âœ… **Local build: WORKS**  
âœ… **Fresh GitHub clone build: WORKS**  
âœ… **All files in GitHub**  
âœ… **All dependencies correct**  
âœ… **Node version specified: 20.x**

## The Issue

Vercel was using Node 22.x instead of 20.x  
**Fixed:** Added `"engines": { "node": "20.x" }` to package.json

## Latest Deployment

Check the latest deployment status:
https://vercel.com/joelhenry2512s-projects/call-via-dashboard

## What To Expect

With Node 20.x specified, Vercel should now:
1. Use correct Node version
2. Build successfully  
3. Deploy your application

## If It Still Fails

Please share the latest build logs. The code builds perfectly on my end, so any remaining issue would be Vercel-specific.

## Success Criteria

âœ… Deployment shows "Ready" status  
âœ… Application loads at the Vercel URL  
âœ… No build errors in logs

---

**All code is ready. Just waiting for Vercel to use the correct Node version!**
